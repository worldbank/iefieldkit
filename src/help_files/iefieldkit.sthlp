{title:Description}

{pstd}This command returns the version of iefieldkit installed. It
	can be used in the beginning of a Master Do-file that is intended to be used
	by multiple users to programmatically test if iefieldkit is not installed for
	the user and therefore need to be installed, or if the version the user has
	installed is too old and needs to be upgraded.{p_end}

{title:Examples}

{pstd}The code below is an example code that can be added to the top of any do-file.
	the example code first test if the command is installed, and install it if not. If it is
	installed, it test if the version is less than version 5.0. If it is, it
	replaces the iefieldkit file with the latest version. In your code you can skip
	the second part if you are not sure which version is required. But you should
	always have the first part testing that {inp:r(version)} has a value before using
	it in less than or greater than expressions.{p_end}

{inp}    cap iefieldkit
{inp}    if "`r(version)'" == "" {
{inp}      *iefieldkit not installed, install it
{inp}      ssc install iefieldkit
{inp}    }
{inp}    else if `r(version)' < 5.0 {
{inp}      iefieldkit version too old, install the latest version
{inp}      ssc install iefieldkit , replace
{inp}    }{text}
